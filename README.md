# EGG-Plotter-App

An open-source, high-density real-time Python desktop application for acquiring, processing, and analyzing 32-channel EEG (Electroencephalogram) signal data streamed over a serial (UART) connection from an STM32 board.

---

## Key Software Features

* **32-Channel 10-20 System Support:** Full support for 32 standard EEG electrode positions (`Fp1`, `Fpz`, `Fp2`, `F7`, `F3`, `Fz`, `F4`, `F8`, `FT7`, `FC3`, etc.) with individual visibility toggles and customizable channel color palettes.
* **Hardware Connection Manager:** Dedicated hardware link module featuring port scanning, connection management, and real-time connection status monitoring for STM32 serial communications.
* **Real-Time Frequency Analysis & Peak Tracking:** Live spectral analysis per channel with configurable `X Max (Hz)` (up to 128 Hz) and `Y Max (mag)` limits, complete with automated peak frequency detection (`peak: X Hz`).
* **Flexible Display Geometry & Grid Customization:** Multi-column layout controls (`Cols`), merge view options, dynamic plot height adjustment, scale sliders, and one-click `Fit to Data`.
* **Session Controls & Data Capture:** Built-in display freeze (`Freeze`), band filter toggles (`Bands`), live data session recording (`Record`), and instant frame captures (`Snapshot`).
* **Electrode Matrix Control:** Quick-access `All On` / `All Off` switches alongside individual electrode matrix checkable lists for targeted multi-lead inspection.

## Serial Connection Manager

The built-in connection manager provides a dedicated control panel for initializing and configuring high-speed serial communication with the host STM32 hardware:

* **Automatic Port Detection:** Scans available system COM / TTY ports on startup.
* **Baud Rate Configuration:** Configurable baud rate selection tailored for high-frequency multi-channel data streaming.
* **Real-Time Link Diagnostics:** Dynamic connection status indicators and hardware handshake logs.

## Session Recording & Data Export

The analyzer includes integrated recording and capture capabilities designed for offline post-processing and analysis:

* **Real-Time File Streaming:** Stream multi-channel raw or filtered EEG data directly to disk during live acquisition sessions.
* **Open Data Formats:** Export recorded sessions into structured CSV or binary files compatible with third-party tools (MNE-Python, EEGLAB, MATLAB).
* **Instant Frame Snapshots:** Single-click high-resolution spectral and waveform snapshots (`Snapshot`) for quick documentation and reporting.
